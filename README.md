# Education & work experience
I majored in Physics but I used only classical electromagnetism for many years.  
until May 2021, as a postdoctoral researcher, I've studied metamaterials; Mainly absorbers working with microwave by computational electrodynamics simulation.   
In 2022, I took an educational course about machine learning/deep learning for about 6 months. (AIFFEL by Modulabs, Korea)  
In SEP 2023, I'm hired as an postdoc researcher in UNIST, Ulsan, Korea

# Repositories
## no updates recently...
- aiffel : What I've done during AIFFEL.
- aiffelthon & rz_cvae : What I've done as a final project of AIFFEL. I was a member of 'red zone' team, trying to monitor&forecast red tide outbreak by CVAE(conditional variational autoencoder). I left the team because of some conflict with team. Whatever I could get some overfitted images before that happense.
- self-study : just a self-study note added recently. various goals.
- ravejs: At this stage this is just a copy of its origin. My friend asked me to help him developing web application similar to this one but 
- shinhan rosy, rosy : It was mid-course project of AIFFEL, analyze some data.

# I don't know where I'm going
When I was young, I wanted to be a SF novelist or Physicist to spread my idea. I decided Physics but finally I concluded that I'm not that good researcher.  
After covid outbreak, I had hard time because of my poor social communication skill. I said that I'll find another field for my career but nowadays I have doubt that if I just wanted to be alone.   
Still I don't know what should I do. There was a research project I was to participate. It was delayed to 2024 and finally canceled recently.
