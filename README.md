# Education & work experience
I majored in Physics but I used only classical electromagnetism for many years.  
until May 2021, as a postdoctoral researcher, I've studied metamaterials; Mainly absorbers working with microwave by computational electrodynamics simulation.   
In 2022, I took an educational course about machine learning/deep learning for about 6 months. (AIFFEL by Modulabs, Korea)  
In SEP 2023, I'm working as an postdoc researcher in UNIST, Ulsan, Korea
