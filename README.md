# About
until May 2020, as a postdoctoral researcher, I've studied metamaterials; Mainly absorbers working with microwave by computational electrodynamics simulation. I majored in Physics but I used only classical electromagnetism for many years.  

## I don't know where I'm going
After covid outbreak, I had hard time because of my poor social communication skill. I said that I'll find another field for my career but nowadays I have doubt that if I just wanted to be alone or not.  
Last year, I took an educational course about machine learning/deep learning for about 5.5 months.  
Still I don't know what should I do. There was a research project I was to participate. It was delayed to 2024 and finally canceled recently.
